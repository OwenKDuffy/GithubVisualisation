# GithubVisualisation

Github API Visualisation Task for CS3012.
View on [this page](https://owenkduffy.github.io/GithubVisualisation/).

Based off of code from [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/learn-to-create-a-line-chart-using-d3-js-4f43f1ee716b)

Github interrogation part 1 [here](https://github.com/OwenKDuffy/GithubAPITask.git).

See branch test for python integration with JSON used to transfer data. Local servers are not updating code so the program is not correctly tested and as such will not be merged until that point.
